# Pneumonia Detection using Federated Learning

This is my license thesis project as a student for Universitatea Thenica din Cluj-Napoca. This project aims to develop a robust pneumonia detection system using federated learning techniques and a web-based interface. The system leverages deep learning models, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, for accurate detection of pneumonia in chest X-ray images.
